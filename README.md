# Pseudo Password Generator (Remastered)
This is a tool for randomly generating passwords consisting of pseudowords. Remastered version for the [existing repository](https://github.com/Astrian/pseudopassword-generator).

A ‘pseudoword’ is a word that is not a meaningful English word in itself, but is spelled according to the rules of pronunciation. These words have a certain randomness, but are easier to remember (in the short term).

When using WPA2-Personal (WPA2-PSK) encryption mode during home WLAN hotspot deployment, the security is related to the randomness of the password. However, it is difficult to manually enter a string that is too random, so a password with pseudowords that combines randomness and ‘pronounceability’ is more suitable for use as a Wi-Fi password.
